**Ruby On Rails Sugar for Espresso.**

_Includes:_ 
* Snippets (the goal is to match much of the TextMate RubyonRails bundle, same syntax used; work begun)
* CodeSense (the goal is to cover ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, ActionPack; work begun)
* Actions (ie, switching between Controller, Model and View, etc.; not yet started)

Intended to complement elliotcable's Ruby sugar (http://github.com/elliottcable/ruby.sugar), and leverages onecrayon's tea-for-espresso (http://github.com/onecrayon/tea-for-espresso)
Based in part on work done by Grzegorz Kazulak (http://github.com/grzegorzkazulak/rails.sugar)
