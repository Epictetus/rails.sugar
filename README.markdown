**Ruby On Rails Sugar for Espresso.**

_Overall goals:_ 

* Snippets (match the TextMate RubyonRails bundle, same triggers)
* CodeSense (cover ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, ActionPack)
* Actions (switching between Controller, Model and View, etc.)

Intended to complement elliotcable's Ruby sugar (http://github.com/elliottcable/ruby.sugar), and leverages onecrayon's tea-for-espresso (http://github.com/onecrayon/tea-for-espresso)

Based in part on some work done by Grzegorz Kazulak (http://github.com/grzegorzkazulak/rails.sugar).

**DONE:**

* Snippets for Controllers, Models, Routes, Views (based off TextMate RoR bundle)
* CodeSense for AR finders, validations, filters, associations


**TODOS:**

* Snippets for Views
* Snippets for Helpers
* Snippets for Tests
* CodeSense for ActiveRecord (finish)
* CodeSense for ActiveSupport
* CodeSense for ActionPack
* Snippets/Codesense for Shoulda (probably as a separate sugar)
* File actions (switch between M, V and C)
* Git support (probably as a separate sugar)
* Run tests, etc. (separate sugar?)
* Find in project (hopefully implemented by MacRabbit in the core)
